# This file describes normalization for the sliders
#
# ========================================================
# Slider range definitions
# ========================================================
#
# Each slider can slide from values between 1-100,
# where 100 is the highest position which represents
# "maximum" pressure on a service and 0 is the lowest
# slider position which represents no pressure being
# applied to the service.
#
# However, the various toxics which can be applied to
# a service need to have raw values supplied to them
# and the associated units vary by service. For example,
# with network toxics the raw value might be applied in
# milliseconds while for container memory, the value might
# be applied in megabytes.
#
# Therefore, we have this file which lists the lower and upper
# bounds for each in raw units. When a slider is moved, we
# do basic division to determine the value to pass into the
# toxic itself. For example, if the range of the memory slider
# in this file is between 100 MB and 1000MB, and the slider
# is set to its midpoint (50), we subtract the lower bound
# from the upper bound (900) and then multiply by 1/100 of
# the slider value to reach the answer of 450. See the
# implementation code for more details on this in action.
#
# Values are represented as a two-element list. The first element
# is the low-bound, which should provide the *best* performance
# (other than being disabled) and the latter value represents the
# high-bound which should represent the *worst* performance outside
# of simply disabling the service.

  # Timeout: Stops all data from getting through, and closes the connection after timeout.

cpu:
  # Impose a CPU CFS quota on the container.
  # The number of microseconds per --cpu-period that the container is limited to before throttled.
  - 25000 # Not totally sure this is also the default for quota. FIXME: Possible bug!
  - 1000    # 1,000 is the lower limit offered by the Docker API
mem:
  # The maximum amount of memory the container can use.
  # Note: We're going to always assume MB
  - 2000 # FIXME What's the default out-of-the-box?
  - 5    # That outta do it. 4MB is the Docker-imposed limit.
